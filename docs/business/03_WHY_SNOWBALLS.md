# 3) Why This Snowballs

**Short version:** every time a promise is *well-judged* before the leap (ABDUCTIO) or *kept* after it (SPONSIO), the next promise becomes easier to believe—and cheaper to keep. Trust compounds, per domain.

---

## The Trust Flywheel (per domain, not one-size-fits-all)

Reputation here isn’t a single number. It lives **inside a domain** like `/coaching/sleep` or `/entrepreneurship/viability_certificate/de`. That matters, because skills don’t transfer perfectly.

**What actually compounds:**
1. **Outcome or export happens**  
   - A SPONSIO outcome is **KEPT**, *or* an ABDUCTIO export is **accepted** and later **holds up**.  
2. **Domain score ticks up**  
   - The agent’s score in *that* domain improves. Not their whole brand—just where it was earned.  
3. **Belief friction falls**  
   - Buyers see higher scores → **conversion and willingness-to-pay** rise.  
4. **Volume increases**  
   - More trials mean more outcomes and more pre-commit analyses.  
5. **Templates get sharper**  
   - We learn which criteria and instruments actually predict success here.  
6. **Kept-rate rises**  
   - Better matching + clearer tests = more promises kept.

> In symbols: **(KEPT outcomes + accepted exports)** → **domain score↑** → **conversion/WTP↑** → **volume↑** → **template quality↑** → **kept-rate↑** → back to start.

*Key point:* this loop runs **independently in each domain**, so excellence compounds exactly where it exists. No reputation laundering.

## Two Flywheels That Feed Each Other

There are really two loops, and they reinforce one another:

- **Pre-commit loop (ABDUCTIO):** clearer expectations → fewer disputes → higher confidence to try → more good fits.
- **Post-commit loop (SPONSIO):** verifiable outcomes → labeled data → better calibration for future ABDUCTIO.

**Together:** SPONSIO produces hard outcomes that teach ABDUCTIO what to believe next time; ABDUCTIO produces clean tests that make SPONSIO decisions boring and automatic.

> **And:** ABDUCTIO stands on its own. You can use it to choose a coach or vet a plan even when no SPONSIO settlement is involved. Its accepted exports still power the flywheel.

## Risk Removal → More First Tries

Most markets stall at the starting line: “I’d try this coach, but I don’t want to get burned.”  
**Sponsio Earnest** solves the hesitation with a simple promise: **“Authorize now; capture only if KEPT.”**  
- Buyers’ perceived risk drops → **trial rate jumps**.  
- Providers see that fair terms convert → **more providers opt in**.

More trials = more outcomes = faster learning = stronger domain scores.

---

## Open Protocol with Boundaries → Parallel Growth

We don’t wait for a monolith to be perfect. The protocol sets **clean boundaries** (domains, instruments, identity levels), so modules grow on their own cadence and still click together:

- **ABDUCTIO** (pre-commit scores + exports)  
- **Sponsio Earnest** (authorize/capture/refund; no custody)  
- **Sponsio Virtual** (issuer-only **Report Passes/Vouchers** to fund pre-commit work and add light sybil friction)

Different teams, different timelines, **one set of rails**. That means we can add surface area fast without adding chaos.

---

## Cooperative Incentives → More, Better Supply

Because this is a cooperative, members aren’t just users—they’re **economic participants**.

- **Patronage (surplus sharing):** when the system works, members get paid back.  
- **Merit (non-monetary, domain-scoped):** influence grows when your templates, tools, and reviews are adopted and hold up.

Result: providers, reviewers, and contributors are **financially and reputationally motivated** to:
- publish clearer templates,
- verify outcomes,
- and invite peers they trust.

In a typical platform, quality leaks to the edges. In a co-op, quality flows back to the people who created it—and they push it forward again.

## Low Marginal Cost Expansion → Wider, Faster

Once the rails exist—**decision exports, payment timing, verification instruments, dispute micro-arbitration**—new domains are mostly **templating**, not engineering.  
- Add a new outcome test, not a new subsystem.  
- Reuse identity and evidence components.  
- Keep the audit export identical across domains.

Every new domain starts with the advantages learned from the last one.

## A 6-Week Story (how the snowball actually rolls)

- **Week 1:** Ten sleep coaches adopt a two-session promise. Clients see a plain ABDUCTIO score *(Credence 0.62, Confidence 0.70)* and try because payment only captures on success.  
- **Week 3:** Outcomes land; 68% are KEPT. Templates update: screening questions tighten; evidence instruments prioritize the ones that predicted success. Similar clients now see *(0.66, 0.73)*.  
- **Week 6:** Disputes drift under 3%. Conversion goes up because the domain page shows **kept-rate and clarity**, not marketing prose. A second cohort of coaches joins—because trust is now **provable**.

Every turn of that loop makes the next turn easier.

---

## Why This Keeps Snowballing (and doesn’t stall)

- **Compounding, domain-scoped trust.** Every KEPT SPONSIO outcome and accepted ABDUCTIO export raises an agent’s score **in that domain** → higher conversion/WTP → more volume → better templates → more keeps.
- **Two flywheels feed each other.** Clear ABDUCTIO expectations ↓ disputes; SPONSIO outcomes label data ↑ calibration.
- **Risk removal boosts trials.** Earnest lowers buyer risk → more first uses → richer reputation.
- **Open protocol with boundaries.** Independent modules ship on their own cadence but interoperate via domains, instruments, and identity.
- **Co-op incentives amplify supply.** Members share surplus and earn merit; they’re **financially and reputationally** motivated to add good templates, verify outcomes, and invite peers.
- **Low marginal cost expansion.** New domains reuse rails (payments timing, verification, disputes); most work is templating, not engineering.

**Bottom line:** trust, once measurable, behaves like capital—it **accumulates** where it’s earned and **earns** where it accumulates. Our job is to keep the loop clean, domain-true, and cooperative so the snowball keeps rolling—and everyone pushing it shares in what it becomes.
