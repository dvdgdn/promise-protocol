# 4) Why It’s Gated

**Short version:** we scale only when each piece proves itself—technically, legally, in the market, and on unit economics. No heroics, no wishful thinking, no “two mediocre things.” Each module (ABDUCTIO, Sponsio Earnest, Sponsio Virtual) earns the right to grow.

---

## The Principle: Speed without wreckage
We move fast **inside** clear guardrails:
- **Small boats, single owners.** Each value line has one accountable lead and its own P&L.
- **Hard gates, not vibes.** If a boat misses a gate twice, it pauses. Fix it or sunset it.
- **Parallel, not tangled.** ABDUCTIO and SPONSIO develop independently; they meet at clean protocol boundaries.

---

## The Four Gates (every boat, every time)

### 1) Technical (can it run by itself?)
- **Auto-decisions ≥ 90%.** Outcomes resolve from pre-registered rules; no manual heroics.
- **Disputes ≤ 3%.** Clear tests mean fewer fights; neutral review < 7 days when needed.
- **Audit trail by default.** Every decision exports a one-page PDF/JSON anyone can read.
- **Identity fit.** Sensitive actions require higher verification (basic → KYC levels).

**Fail twice?** Pause growth, fix the template or instrument, re-run a small pilot.

---

### 2) Legal & Compliance (will it get us pancaked?)
- **ABDUCTIO:** documents + reasoning only; GDPR basics (lawful basis, transparency, erasure workflow).
- **Sponsio Earnest:** **authorize → capture/refund** via a licensed PSP; we never hold client funds. No “escrow/wallet” language.
- **Sponsio Virtual:** issuer-only **Report Passes/Vouchers** (closed loop, no cash-out, no P2P). Track limited-network thresholds; narrow catalog.
- **Claims hygiene:** coaching ≠ medicine; measurable improvements, not healing promises.
- **DSA posture:** simple notice-and-action; transparency by design.

**Fail twice?** Narrow scope (e.g., reduce voucher catalog), change copy, or partner for licensing before proceeding.

---

### 3) Market (does anyone want it under fair terms?)
- **ABDUCTIO acceptance ≥ 80%.** Recipients (e.g., reviewer/bank/agency) accept our export; reviewer prep time ≤ 90 minutes.
- **Earnest provider opt-in ≥ 60%** after first run; clients convert because risk is fair (“authorize now; capture on kept”).
- **Virtual clarity:** < 2% of tickets confuse vouchers with “money.”

**Fail twice?** Tighten the promise template and screening; fix the onboarding copy; try again with a smaller, clearer wedge.

---

### 4) Economics (does it pay for its own fuel?)
- **Positive contribution margin** after PSP fees and support.
- **CAC < ⅓ of 6-month gross margin.**
- **Time-to-cash < 30 days.** No long, slow AR tails.

**Fail twice?** Adjust pricing/mix (base fee vs success component), reduce support minutes, or drop the domain.

---

## Governance Gates (coherence without bottlenecks)
- **Core protocol = reserved matters.** Multi-class majority; changed rarely.
- **Domain standards = class-majority.** Providers vote on provider rules; reviewers on evidence rules.
- **Experiments = permissionless.** If it passes core specs, it can ship to a small cohort.
- **WIP limits.** Max two active boats in build/scale at once; others docked.

---

## The Pause Playbook (what happens when a gate fails)
1. **Freeze acquisition** in that boat (no new customers).  
2. **Publish the gap** (e.g., disputes at 5.4% vs 3% target).  
3. **Change one thing** (template, instrument, eligibility, copy) and re-run a 10–20 case pilot.  
4. **Two green months** before resuming scale.

---

## A Tiny Scenario (gates working as designed)
- **Week 3:** Earnest–Sleep shows disputes at 4.8%. Gate tripped.  
- **Action:** We tighten eligibility (baseline diary compliance ≥ 6/7) and switch the rule from “best night” to “7-day median.”  
- **Week 6:** Disputes drop to 2.6%, auto-decisions rise to 93%. Gate cleared, growth resumes.

---

## What We Won’t Do (until gates are green)
- Custody client funds or market “escrow.”  
- Ship transferable or cash-redeemable credits.  
- Make medical claims.  
- Expand beyond two domains at once.  
- Scale a boat with manual decisions, fuzzy tests, or negative margin.

---

## Why Gating Makes the Snowball Faster, Not Slower
- **Cleaner data in, better predictions out.** Gates force clear tests and good evidence, which improve ABDUCTIO’s *(Credence, Confidence)* next time.  
- **Trust you can publish.** Metrics are simple and public: kept-rate, acceptance, auto-decision %, disputes %, margin.  
- **Focused teams win.** Boats don’t wait on a central backlog; they just have to pass the gates.

**Bottom line:** gates turn momentum into durable progress. We earn scale with proof, not promises—ironically, the only promise worth making.
