# 10) Business Model & Pricing

**Plain idea:** we earn a fair, transparent fee when we help people make **better decisions (ABDUCTIO)** and settle **fair outcomes (SPONSIO)**—and we return surplus to members because we’re a cooperative.

---

## Revenue lines (what we charge for)

### A) ABDUCTIO (pre-commit judgment)
- **Per-export** (reviewer lane): **€59** per signed viability export **or** **€199/mo** for up to **6** exports (then €39/export).  
- **Self-serve (no reviewer)**: **€29** per one-page *(Credence, Confidence)* with PDF/JSON export.  
- **Enterprise/API** (later): seat + usage.

**Why this is fair:** value is created *before* money moves—clarity saves time and rework. Exports are reproducible and portable.

---

### B) SPONSIO Earnest (outcomes, no custody)
- **Platform take on the success component only:** **8%** of **captured** success fees *(or)* **€39/mo + 5%** for coaches who prefer SaaS.  
- **Base fees:** 0% platform take; the coach’s base fee is captured at booking per template.  
- **Caps:** per-transaction fee capped at **€60** to keep high-ticket cases fair.

**Why this is fair:** we earn only when **KEPT** outcomes settle. No fee if the success component is refunded.

---

### C) SPONSIO Virtual (closed-loop fuel)
- **Report Passes / Vouchers**: issuer-only credits **redeemable only for ABDUCTIO exports** (no cash-out, no P2P).  
  - Starter pack: **5 passes = €250** (5× €59 export value at a discount).  
- **Accounting:** deferred revenue → recognized on redemption.  
- **We do *not* rely on breakage.** Unused passes can be reassigned to another founder or extended within policy.

---

### D) Co-op membership (optional but rewarded)
- **Provider/Reviewer membership:** **€29/mo**; access to templates, white-label exports, partner pages, and **patronage** eligibility.  
- **Worker/Contributor membership:** free; earns **merit** and patronage via work/usage.

---

## How money flows (Earnest example)

**Sleep template (coach sets: base €200, success €300)**  
- Client authorizes €300 success component; base €200 captured at booking.  
- Outcome **KEPT** → capture €300; platform takes **8% of €300 = €24** (coach receives €476 net of platform + PSP fees).  
- Outcome **NOT KEPT** → auto-refund €300; platform takes **€0**.

> We never hold funds; acquirer/PSP runs authorize → capture/refund. No “escrow” marketing.

---

## Co-op economics (how surplus returns to members)

At year-end, after reserves and capped share dividends (if any), **surplus** is shared as **patronage** by usage (illustrative initial policy):
- **Providers (coaches)** — ~50% of patronage pool (proportional to net GMV from **KEPT** outcomes).  
- **Reviewers** — ~20% (proportional to verified ABDUCTIO exports used).  
- **Workers** — ~25% (wage share/hours).  
- **Users/Beneficiaries** — ~5% (engagement).  

**Merit is separate (not money):** it increases domain governance weight and unlocks bounties; it’s not tradable or cashable.

---

## Price integrity (simple rules we stick to)
- **No custody.** We only time payments via PSPs.  
- **No junk fees.** Prices are posted and simple; disputes don’t monetize.  
- **No pay-to-boost reputation.** Merit and domain scores are earned by outcomes and adoption, not spend.  
- **Caps on platform take.** High-ticket fairness matters.

---

## Unit economics (skeptic-friendly snapshot)

**Assumptions (MVP targets)**
- PSP blended fee: **2.2% + €0.25**.  
- Support: **20 min/ticket** median; **≤3%** disputes.  
- Earnest auto-decision: **≥90%**.  
- ABDUCTIO reviewer prep time: **≤90 min** median.

**Illustrative per-case**
- **ABDUCTIO export:** €59 revenue – (€3 infra + €5 support) ≈ **€51** contribution.  
- **Earnest (sleep, KEPT):** success €300 → platform fee €24 – (€1.85 PSP on success component share + €3 infra + €4 support) ≈ **€15** contribution.  
- **Earnest (NOT KEPT):** €0 platform fee – (tiny infra, support) ≈ **−€2**; minimized by clear templates.

**Gates we enforce before scaling**
- **Positive contribution margin** per boat.  
- **CAC < ⅓** of 6-month gross margin.  
- **Time-to-cash < 30 days.**

## Pricing by customer type (so sales knows what to quote)

| Customer | What they buy | Price (MVP) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reviewer firm | ABDUCTIO exports | €59/export or €199/mo up to 6; €39 thereafter | White-label; signing; VC/PDF |
| Solo coach (sleep) | Earnest processing | 8% of captured success **or** €39/mo + 5% | Base fee 0% take; fee cap €60 |
| Client (sleep) | — | Pays coach set price | Sees pass rule up front |
| Founder (viability) | Report Passes | 5 for €250 | Redeemable only for ABDUCTIO exports |

---

## Promotions & discounts (clean, not tricky)
- **Member discount:** providers/reviewers who are co-op members get **10% off** platform fees (or extra patronage weight).  
- **Volume tiers:** reviewer plans step down export price after 6/month.  
- **Founders pack:** first-time founders get **1 free ABDUCTIO self-serve** with the purchase of 5 Report Passes.

---

## What we won’t do (to keep trust)
- No revenue from **holding** client funds (we don’t).  
- No **transferable** or **cash-redeemable** virtual credits.  
- No **ad taxes** on discovery pages; domain rankings come from **kept outcomes** and **accepted exports**, not spend.

---

## The one-liner for pricing pages
- **ABDUCTIO:** “Decide with justified confidence — from €29.”  
- **Earnest:** “Authorize now; **pay only if it works** — 8% of the success component (capped).”  
- **Virtual:** “Fuel reviews safely — Report Passes redeemable only for ABDUCTIO exports.”

**Bottom line:** simple fees where value is created, capped where it should be, and a cooperative surplus that returns to the people who keep their promises and help others do the same.
