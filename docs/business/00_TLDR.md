# Promise Foundation — TL;DRE (One-Pager)

## Mission
Make internet promises credible. **ABDUCTIO** turns fuzzy expectations into *justifiable, testable* specs; **SPONSIO** settles *verifiable outcomes*. A cooperative (eG) stewards the open protocol and shares surplus with members.

---

## What We Ship Now
- **ABDUCTIO (free spec + paid exports):** Structured viability dossiers (DE *Tragfähigkeits­bescheinigung*), reproducible forecasts, VC/PDF exports.
- **SPONSIO Earnest (money, no custody):** “Authorize now; capture only if KEPT.” Outcome-contingent fees via PSP auth/capture/refund + dispute micro-arbitration.
- **SPONSIO Virtual (no money):** **Merit** (non-transferable trust score) + **Report Passes/Vouchers** (issuer-only, redeemable for ABDUCTIO outputs) to fund reviews and add sybil friction.

---

## Why This Snowballs
- **Compounding, domain-scoped trust:** Each KEPT outcome / accepted export lifts scores → higher conversion/WTP → more volume → better templates → more keeps.
- **Dual flywheels:** Clear ABDUCTIO ↓ disputes; SPONSIO outcomes label data ↑ calibration.
- **Risk removal:** Earnest lowers buyer risk, increasing first trials and data.
- **Open rails, parallel growth:** Independent modules interoperate via domains, instruments, identity levels.
- **Co-op incentives:** Members earn **patronage** (surplus share) and **merit** (governance weight in domains). They’re *financially and reputationally* motivated to add templates, verify outcomes, and invite peers.
- **Low marginal cost expansion:** New domains are mostly configuration (templates + instruments) on shared rails.

---

## Why It’s Gated
- **Technical gates:** auto-decision ≥90%, disputes ≤3%, adherence rules met, audit PDF/JSON for every decision.
- **Legal gates:** Earnest = PSP timing (no custody/“escrow”); Virtual = closed-loop vouchers (issuer-only, no cash-out); GDPR/DSA hygiene; health-claim guardrails.
- **Market gates:** ABDUCTIO acceptance ≥80%; Earnest provider opt-in ≥60% after first run.
- **Economic gates:** positive contribution margin; CAC < ⅓ of 6-mo gross margin. Miss a gate twice → pause & fix.

---

## Why It’s a Fleet (Rendanheyi in a Co-op)
Many small, self-funding **boats** (micro-enterprises) with their own P&L and gates, sharing the **dockyard** (protocol rails). Contracts and prices, not hierarchy.
- **Boat A:** ABDUCTIO-DE (viability exports)
- **Boat B:** SPONSIO Earnest — Sleep
- **Next:** Earnest — Smoking; Virtual — Merit & Report Passes

## Layers & Rails (at a glance)

| Layer | Purpose | Unit | Transferable? | Legal posture | Where it shows up |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Merit (separate)** | Measure trustworthiness per domain | Score (not money) | No | Not monetary | Weighting, stake discounts, evidence thresholds |
| **Sponsio Earnest** | Money outcomes w/o custody | EUR auth/capture/refund | n/a | Payment-timing tool | Success fees, auto-refunds, disputes |
| **Sponsio Virtual** | Skin-in-game w/o money | Issuer-only vouchers | No P2P/cash-out | Limited-network | Fund ABDUCTIO, throttle sybils |
| **Sponsio Core (v1.0.0, later)** | True staking/slashing | Sponsio Credit | Yes (per rules) | May resemble stored value → later | Stakes for promises & assessments |

*Why Merit is separate:* it’s the **measurement** layer, not payments—kept non-transferable to preserve integrity and avoid regulatory creep while modulating stakes/evidence across all rails.

## Customers & Wedges
- **Reviewers/Founders:** DE viability dossiers faster, accepted, reproducible.
- **Coaches/Clients:** Outcome-contingent sleep & smoking programs with fair, auditable rules.

---

## Go-to-Market (first 12 weeks)
1) Recruit 5–10 reviewer partners + 10 sleep coaches; finalize two templates.  
2) Ship ABDUCTIO export + Earnest flow; run 20–30 promises & 10–20 dossiers.  
3) Add Virtual vouchers for ABDUCTIO; publish 3 case studies; first co-op GA.

---

## Monetization
- ABDUCTIO exports: per-dossier or small monthly plan.  
- Earnest: % of **captured success component** (+ optional SaaS).  
- Membership dues (co-op).  
- Virtual: issuer-only vouchers for ABDUCTIO outputs (deferred revenue).

---

## Metrics We Publish
Kept-rate by domain; ABDUCTIO acceptance; auto-decision %; disputes %; contribution margin per boat; voucher threshold tracker; governance health (active members, merit distribution).

---

## Ask (if capital involved)
Bounded, mission-aligned capital for two boats to clear **G2** gates (with our **Investor Charter**: capped returns, no control, boat-level revenue shares or subordinated member loans). Otherwise: grant/bounty support for open specs.

**Bottom line:** A cooperative, gated-snowball-fleet approach that compounds trust while scaling only when it’s provably compliant, automatable, and profitable.
