# 1) Problem → Insight — for first-time readers

## The Problem: We can’t tell what to believe *before* we commit
You’ve lived this:
- A coach promises “life-changing results,” and nothing changes.
- A freelancer says “two weeks,” and it drags for months.
- An AI gives you confident answers—but you don’t know if they’re **right**.

We’re drowning in information and “intelligence,” yet we still make expensive decisions on **vibes**. Reviews are gamed, credentials don’t transfer between topics, and contracts are slow and fuzzy about success. The real failure happens **pre-commit**: we can’t orchestrate all that information into a clear, justified **“yes” or “no”** before we spend time and money.

## The Two Moments Every Promise Has
1) **Pre-commit:** *Should I believe this claim?*  
2) **Post-commit:** *Did the promised outcome actually happen?*

Most systems mush these together. That’s why we argue later instead of deciding well now.

## The Insight: Split the lifecycle and make each side measurable

### ABDUCTIO (pre-commit) — justified belief before you leap
ABDUCTIO turns a claim into **two numbers** you can act on:

- **Credence** — “How likely is this to be true?” (a probability)
- **Confidence** — “How sure am I about that estimate?” (how stable the number is given evidence)

Together, they’re a **pre-commit promise score**: *(Credence, Confidence)*.  
High credence + high confidence → go.  
Low credence + high confidence → don’t.  
Low confidence → investigate more **only if the stakes justify it**.

How it works in practice (simple flow):
1. **State the claim** you’re considering (“This program will improve my sleep by ≥6 ISI points.”)
2. **Decompose** it into smaller claims (method works, fits my profile, I’ll adhere, metric is valid).
3. **Check evidence** for each sub-claim (data, expert input, your past behavior).
4. **Aggregate** into one credence and one confidence, with a short, readable justification.
5. **Stop** when the investigation is “enough for the stakes” (ABDUCTIO guides this stopping rule).

Result: a one-page, auditable rationale you can share. No jargon needed.

> **Important:** ABDUCTIO stands alone. You can use it to choose a coach, evaluate a product, vet a business idea, or decide whether to move cities—*even if no one else is on our platform.*

### SPONSIO (post-commit) — money moves only when outcomes are verified
SPONSIO starts **after** you commit. You pre-register a simple pass/fail rule (“If ISI ≤ 12 at week 4, capture the success fee; else refund it”). The outcome is measured; payment is captured or refunded automatically. No custody. No he-said-she-said. Just the rule everyone agreed to.

> **Complementary, not required:** SPONSIO is useful when a promise involves payment and both sides want **automatic, verifiable settlement**. ABDUCTIO does not depend on it.

---

## Why this beats the status quo
- **From vibes to verdicts:** ABDUCTIO compresses infinite info into *(Credence, Confidence)* with a clear “enough-evidence” rule.
- **From effort to outcomes:** SPONSIO settles on what happened, not how hard someone tried.
- **Domain-aware trust:** Reputation is specific (sleep ≠ business coaching). You earn trust where you deliver.
- **Cooperative incentives:** As a co-op, members share surplus and earn merit—so they’re financially and reputationally motivated to improve templates, evidence, and outcomes.

## A quick example
**Claim:** “Two sessions will improve my sleep by ≥6 ISI points.”  
**ABDUCTIO output:** *(Credence 0.62, Confidence 0.7)* with a 1-page breakdown (method evidence, fit, adherence risk).  
**Decision:** For a €500 program and this level of certainty, you proceed or you choose a cheaper trial.  
**If you proceed with SPONSIO:** “Authorize now, capture only if ISI ≤ 12 at week 4.” The test runs, payment settles automatically, and an audit PDF is saved.

---

## Why now
- **LLMs** make decomposition and evidence-gathering cheap and fast.
- **Payment APIs** make authorize/capture/refund reliable (no custody needed).
- **Remote services** make measurable outcomes practical.

**Bottom line:**  
ABDUCTIO gives you **justified confidence before you act**.  
SPONSIO gives you **automatic fairness after you act**.  
Use them together or separately—but stop guessing. Start deciding.
