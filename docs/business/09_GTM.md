# 9) Go-to-Market (12 Weeks)

**Goal:** launch two boats (ABDUCTIO—Viability; SPONSIO Earnest—Sleep), add SPONSIO Virtual to fuel ABDUCTIO, and **only scale** when each gate (technical, legal, market, economics) is **green**. If a gate fails twice, we **pause, fix, micro-pilot,** then resume.

---

## Week 0 (prep) — “Dockyard ready”
**Deliverables**
- Tiny **Domain Registry** online with:  
  `/entrepreneurship/viability` standards (`_opinionExport`, `_assumptionLogComplete`, `_reviewerSignature`, …)  
  `/coaching/sleep` standards (`_twoSessionISIImprovement`, `_sleepLatencyReduction`, `_diaryAdherenceAtLeast`, `_twoSessionsWithinDays`)
- **Decision Export** (1-page PDF/JSON): pass/fail, rule, timestamps, baseline/follow-up.
- **Identity Levels:** basic → `kyc1` for signing/captures.
- **Payment rail (Earnest):** PSP sandbox flows for authorize → capture/refund.
- **Evidence kit:** ISI + 7-day sleep diary; nicotine daily check-ins (for later).
- **Legal packet v0.9:** ToS (no custody/escrow; decision-support), Privacy Notice (lawful bases; Art. 13/14), DPA, LIA (legitimate interest for reputation), health-claims guardrails.

**Gates to clear (Go/No-Go)**
- *Technical:* demo auto-decision end-to-end in sandbox; export renders identically across domains.  
- *Legal:* counsel sign-off: **no custody**, **no “escrow/wallet” language**, voucher wording “issuer-only, no cash-out,” GDPR notices ready.

**If fail:** no external pilots.

---

## Weeks 1–2 — “Recruit & prime the lanes”
**Actions**
- Sign **5–10 reviewer partners** (letters of intent, target: 50+ dossiers in 90 days).  
- Enlist **10 sleep coaches** for Earnest trial (two-session template).  
- Publish two **Proof Pages**: `/entrepreneurship/viability` and `/coaching/sleep` with template copy, instruments, and sample decision export.  
- Train partners (1-hour zoom; sandbox runs).

**Gates**
- *Market:* ≥5 reviewers + ≥10 coaches confirmed with calendar slots.  
- *Legal (Virtual pre-work):* voucher T&Cs drafted: **issuer-only**, redeemable **only** for ABDUCTIO outputs, **no P2P**, **no cash-out**, limited catalog; threshold counter live.

**If fail:** replace slow partners; narrow copy; re-recruit.

---

## Weeks 3–4 — “First live cases (tight loop)”
**ABDUCTIO—Viability (Reviewer lane)**
- Run **10–20 dossiers**. Measure: prep time, acceptance feedback, recipient questions.  
- Ship **opinion export** (PDF/JSON) with reviewer signature.

**Earnest—Sleep (Coach lane)**
- Run **20–30 promises** using:  
  Path A (ISI ≥6 drop) or Path B (SOL & WASO ≥20 min deltas); **adherence rule** ≥6/7 diary entries.

**Gates**
- *Technical:* **Auto-decision ≥90%**; Decision Export attached to every case.  
- *Market:* reviewers’ **prep time ≤90 min (median)**.  
- *Legal:* zero support tickets confusing Earnest with escrow; disclaimers render on coach pages.

**If fail:** adjust templates (e.g., switch to 7-day **median** not “best night”), strengthen onboarding copy, micro-pilot 5 more cases before opening week 5.

---

## Weeks 5–6 — “Tighten the screws”
**Improve templates from real data**
- Sleep: refine screening Qs (exclude travel weeks), tweak thresholds if borderline disputes show up.  
- Viability: add a short **risk section** and **evidence checklist** to cut recipient questions.

**Publish first **Case Briefs** (3 stories):** “What we promised, how we measured, what happened.”

**Gates**
- *Market:* ABDUCTIO **acceptance ≥80%**; Earnest **disputes ≤3%**.  
- *Economics:* time-to-cash < 30 days; contribution margin breakeven on both boats (PSP + support included).

**If fail:** pause acquisition for that boat, fix one variable (eligibility, pass rule, or copy), re-run a **10-case micro-pilot**.

---

## Weeks 7–8 — “Add SPONSIO Virtual to fuel ABDUCTIO”
**Ship Virtual (closed-loop)**
- **Report Passes/Vouchers:** sell issuer-only credits redeemable **only** for viability **ABDUCTIO** exports.  
- UI labels: “Report Pass — redeemable only for ABDUCTIO exports; **no cash-out, no transfer**.”  
- **Merit v1:** simple domain-scoped evaluator score for reviewers/AI (adoptions × quality).

**Gates**
- *Legal:* voucher receipts show “issuer-only”; **LNE threshold counter** visible to ops; <2% tickets confuse vouchers with money.  
- *Market:* ≥30% of viability exports funded/redeemed via Report Passes in week 8.

**If fail:** simplify catalog (only viability exports), tighten labeling, publish “How Report Passes work” explainer; re-measure.

---

## Weeks 9–10 — “Scale carefully if gates are green”
**Expand volume without new domains**
- Reviewers: open a small self-serve funnel; keep white-label for partners.  
- Coaches: add 10 more sleep coaches; keep the **two-template** limit.

**SLOs & ops**
- Support **≤24h** first response; disputes **≤7 days** to resolve (neutral review path).  
- Identity: require `kyc1` for reviewers signing exports and for coaches capturing success fees.

**Gates**
- *Technical:* **Export failure rate <1%**; monitoring alerts on PSP errors.  
- *Economics:* CAC < ⅓ of 6-mo gross margin; ops load ≤20 min/support ticket (median).

**If fail:** freeze ads/SEO, return to partner-led only; add in-product guardrails to reduce support minutes.

---

## Weeks 11–12 — “Publish, prove, decide”
**Publish**
- Public **Metrics Page**: kept-rate (sleep), acceptance (viability), auto-decision %, disputes %, voucher usage %, basic economics (contribution margin trend).  
- **Template v2 drafts** if data warrants (version, don’t break v1).  
- **Co-op GA #1:** admit first members; adopt surplus policy; review gates.

**Decide: scale, pivot, or dock**
- If both boats are **green two months running**, plan next domain **adjacent** (smoking or web/services).  
- If a boat is yellow/red, keep only **maintenance** customers; focus the team on fixes.

**Final 12-week Gates (Go to Scale)**
- *ABDUCTIO (Reviewer lane):*  
  - Acceptance **≥80%**; prep time **≤90 min** median; ≥40% 6-month follow-up opt-in booked.  
- *Earnest (Sleep):*  
  - **Auto-decision ≥90%**, **disputes ≤3%**, coach **opt-in ≥60%** after first run.  
- *Virtual:*  
  - ≥60% of viability exports **funded by Report Passes**; <2% voucher confusion tickets.  
- *Economics:*  
  - Positive contribution margin on both boats; CAC < ⅓ of 6-mo gross margin; time-to-cash < 30 days.  
- *Legal:*  
  - No custody; PSP wording live; voucher LNE posture documented; GDPR/DSA basics in place.

## Ops artifacts you’ll have at the end
- **Playbooks:** reviewer export checklist; coach Earnest setup checklist; dispute micro-arb SOP.  
- **Contracts:** partner MoU (reviewer/coach), voucher T&Cs, DPA + LIA on file.  
- **Dashboards:** per-boat gate board (stoplight), SLO panel (support & decision latency), voucher threshold tracker.  
- **Public assets:** Proof Pages, Case Briefs, Metrics Page.

---

## Message you can use day one
- **For reviewers:** “Accepted viability opinions in **≤90 minutes** prep, with a one-page audit you can stand behind.”  
- **For coaches:** “**Authorize now; capture only if KEPT.** Clear rules, fewer disputes, better close rates.”  
- **For clients/founders:** “Know what you’re buying **before** you pay. Settle **only** if it works.”

**Bottom line:** we don’t pray for product-market fit; we **gate** for it. If it’s green, we scale. If it’s not, we stop, fix one thing, and try again—without sinking the fleet.
