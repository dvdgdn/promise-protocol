# 19) FAQ for the Skeptic

> **Tone:** direct, first-time friendly, no jargon.  
> **Big picture:** we split promises into two moments—**before** you commit (ABDUCTIO) and **after** (SPONSIO). You can use either alone.

---

### 1) Isn’t this just escrow with extra steps?
**No.** We never hold client funds. **Sponsio Earnest** uses standard payment rails:
- **Authorize now → capture or refund** when the pre-agreed rule fires.
- Clear, one-page **decision export** shows the rule, evidence hashes, and outcome.
“Escrow/wallet” language is banned in product and contracts.

---

### 2) Why not just use contracts, SLAs, and reviews?
- **Contracts** are slow and binary; most disputes are about *degree*.
- **SLAs** still need someone to judge success.
- **Reviews** are gamed and lagging.  
We make the success test **explicit up front** (SPONSIO) and we help you **decide before committing** (ABDUCTIO).

---

### 3) Can I use ABDUCTIO without SPONSIO?
**Yes.** ABDUCTIO stands alone. It turns a claim into two numbers:
- **Credence** (how likely this is true *for you*), and
- **Confidence** (how sure we are about that estimate),
plus a short, readable rationale. No money movement required.

---

### 4) Won’t LLMs just hallucinate fancy answers?
We don’t ask an AI to “be right.” We ask it to:
- **Decompose** the claim,
- Attach **evidence**,
- Output **Credence + Confidence**, and
- Show a **stopping rule** matched to the stakes.  
We store model version, prompts, seeds, and inputs; we **calibrate** over time against real outcomes (Brier/log scores). High-stakes cases can add human review.

---

### 5) What if outcomes are subjective?
For **money-moving** promises we require **objective or structured-subjective** instruments (e.g., ISI + sleep diary). Purely subjective (“felt better”) goes to **Merit** and learning signals—not automatic settlement.

---

### 6) How do you stop “best-night screenshots” and other gaming?
- Use **7-day medians**, not single nights.
- **Adherence rules** (e.g., ≥6/7 diary entries).
- Optional **third-party checks** (e.g., cotinine).
- **Random audits** and down-weight repeated pairs.
- One-page export shows the window and stats.

---

### 7) Won’t good providers cherry-pick easy clients?
Some screening is healthy. We publish **case-mix** and move to **difficulty-adjusted kept-rates** as data grows. Cherry-picking that harms clients shows up in domain stats; templates can set eligibility clearly.

---

### 8) Is this gambling, prediction markets, or derivatives?
**No.** There are:
- No tradable markets,
- No transferable stake tokens in MVP,
- No promotion of event betting.  
Sponsio Earnest is **bilateral service settlement** on a pre-registered rule. A future **Sponsio Core** (true staking) happens only with proper licensing/partners.

---

### 9) Are your “vouchers” just e-money in disguise?
**No.** **Report Passes** are issuer-only, **redeemable only for ABDUCTIO exports**, non-transferable, and **no cash-out**. That’s a closed-loop, limited-network posture. We track thresholds and label them plainly (“Report Pass”).

---

### 10) Who verifies outcomes—won’t this turn into endless he-said-she-said?
Most decisions **auto-resolve** because the test is pre-agreed. If something’s unclear:
- Time-boxed **neutral review** window (e.g., ≤7 days),
- Same evidence pack, same export.  
If a template causes frequent disputes, it’s paused and fixed.

---

### 11) Doing both ABDUCTIO and SPONSIO sounds risky. Why not do one well?
We agree—**doing two badly is worse than one well.** That’s why we run **separate boats with gates**:
- Each boat must pass **technical, legal, market, and economics** gates **twice** before scaling.
- If a gate turns red, that boat pauses. The other keeps sailing.

---

### 12) How do you protect privacy, especially for health-adjacent data?
- **Minimize** what we collect; separate evidence storage; encrypt at rest/in transit.
- **Redaction** keeps the audit hash but removes PII.
- **Explicit consent** for special categories (e.g., sleep diaries).
- **DPIA/ROPA** on file; 72-hour incident plan.

---

### 13) Are you building a reputation score that follows me everywhere?
No. Reputation is **domain-scoped** (e.g., `/coaching/sleep`). Your sleep reputation doesn’t lift your business-coaching ranking. We show **where** trust was earned.

---

### 14) Can people buy or trade reputation?
**No.** **Merit** is **non-transferable** and **not money**. It weights voice in domain standards and modulates required evidence/holds. You earn it by being reliably right, not by spending.

---

### 15) What prevents fake clients and collusive success?
- **Identity tiers** for higher-stakes actions,
- **Payment authorization** ties success to a real instrument,
- **Repeated-pair down-weighting**, cross-camp agreement checks,
- Random **audits** and optional third-party tests.

---

### 16) Your Earnest take looks low. Is the business viable?
Earnest is intentionally **non-extractive**. Most margin comes from **ABDUCTIO exports**; Earnest proves outcomes and fuels adoption. We gate on **contribution margin**, **CAC/payback**, and **time-to-cash** before scaling.

---

### 17) Why a cooperative instead of a VC-maximizing platform?
Because incentives matter. In a co-op:
- **Patronage** returns surplus by usage,
- **Merit** recognizes domain expertise,
- Governance protects core protocol with **concurrent majorities**.  
That keeps us honest: no ad-ranking shenanigans, no pay-to-boost reputations.

---

### 18) How do you avoid legal landmines?
- **No custody**; never market “escrow.”
- **Closed-loop vouchers** only, labeled as such.
- **Measurable-improvement** language, not medical cures.
- Pause the boat if support tickets show confusion (e.g., “is this money?”).

---

### 19) My program runs longer than card holds. Then what?
Use the **capture + auto-refund** pattern for the success component, or re-authorize at milestones. Same decision export; same fairness.

---

### 20) What if your numbers are cherry-picked?
We publish:
- **Wilson lower bounds** beside every rate,
- **n** (sample size) and the template version,
- Case-mix where relevant.  
Every decision links to a **verifiable export** (QR + hash).

---

### 21) How do you handle chargebacks?
The export is built for that: timestamps, rule, evidence summary. Merchants respond with the single page. We favor mediation over fights; if the template is the problem, we fix it.

---

### 22) Won’t this punish providers for taking hard cases?
We’re moving to **difficulty-adjusted kept-rates** (case-mix aware) and show **lower confidence intervals**, not just point estimates. Taking hard cases that still succeed earns **Merit**.

---

### 23) Who sets the rules for a domain?
- **Core protocol** (payments, evidence integrity) → **reserved matters** (concurrent majorities).
- **Domain standards** (e.g., sleep instruments) → **class majority** with **Merit weighting** (capped 3×).
- **Experiments** ship permissionlessly if they pass core specs; adoption decides.

---

### 24) Can ABDUCTIO help me with big, messy decisions (e.g., “Should I start this business?”)
Yes. That’s its sweet spot. It decomposes the claim, scores sub-claims, and tells you **how sure to be**—and when to stop digging. You can show the one-pager to a reviewer, co-founder, or lender.

---

### 25) What happens when something goes wrong publicly?
We don’t spin. We:
- Publish the **decision export**,
- Issue a **good-will refund** if warranted,
- **Patch the template**, and
- Note the incident on the **Metrics Page**.  
If a gate turns red, we **pause intake**.

---

### 26) How do I leave if I don’t like it?
You can export your decision records (JSON/PDF), delete your account (with lawful retention for finance), and keep using the public templates under open licenses.

---

### 27) Why now?
Three things finally make this practical:
1) LLMs can **decompose and calibrate** cheaply,
2) Payment APIs support clean **authorize/capture/refund** flows,
3) Remote services are normal—so **outcome-based** settlement is actually usable.

---

### 28) What’s the moat if the code is open?
- **Domain-scoped trust data** and decision exports (the receipts),
- The **co-op network** of reviewers/coaches who win by contributing,
- The **protocol** and governance that keep incentives clean.  
Forks can copy code, not community trust.

---

### 29) What stops you from moving fast and breaking things?
**Gates.** Boats don’t scale unless **technical, legal, market, and economics** are green for two consecutive months. Any red → pause, fix one thing, micro-pilot, resume.

---

### 30) What’s the fastest way to see if this is real?
- Run **ABDUCTIO** on a small decision and read the one-pager.
- Try a **Sponsio Earnest** template with a fair success rule.
- Redeem a **Report Pass** for a viability export.  
If those three feel clear and boring, the system is doing its job.

---

**Bottom line:** we don’t promise certainty; we promise **justified confidence** before you act and **boring, verifiable settlement** after you do. If any of that stops being true, a gate turns red and the boat stops.
