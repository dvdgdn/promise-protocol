# 8) Market & Customers

**Plain idea:** start where the pain is sharp, the win is provable, and the decision-maker is close to the problem. We land two “boats” (ABDUCTIO—Viability; SPONSIO Earnest—Sleep), then expand by repeating the same pattern in adjacent domains.

---

## Who feels the pain first (two obvious wedges)

### 1) Reviewers & Founders — **Viability opinions faster, cleaner**
- **Primary buyer:** small reviewer firms (Steuerberater/Unternehmensberater) who issue viability opinions for founders.
- **User pain:** hours lost wrangling spreadsheets and PDFs; inconsistent quality; recipient rejections.
- **Why they buy:** ABDUCTIO produces a one-page *(Credence, Confidence)* and a clean **opinion export** they can sign. It’s faster to prepare, easier to accept, and leaves an audit trail.
- **End user:** founders who need a recognized dossier; they can prepay with **Report Passes/Vouchers** (Virtual) and get a turnaround they can plan for.

**Offer:** “**Viability, ready to submit**: guided intake → reviewer signs → export (PDF/JSON). Most reports prepped in ≤90 minutes.”

---

### 2) Coaches & Clients — **Sleep results with fair settlement**
- **Primary buyer:** independent sleep coaches and small coaching teams.
- **User pain:** low conversion (clients scared to risk money), high refund drama, vague success criteria.
- **Why they buy:** **Sponsio Earnest** removes the buyer’s fear (“authorize now; capture only if KEPT”), and the template makes acceptance objective (e.g., ISI drop or diary deltas).
- **End user:** clients who want to try coaching **once** if it’s fair—then tell friends when it works.

**Offer:** “**Two sessions, clear outcome**: pre-register the rule; if kept we capture the success fee; if not, we don’t.”

## Ideal Customer Profiles (so we qualify fast)

**Reviewer ICP**
- 2–20 people, recurring viability work, wants standardized outputs.
- Comfortable signing opinions; open to a reproducible workflow.
- Values time saved and fewer recipient questions.

**Coach ICP (sleep)**
- Already winning *some* outcomes, but losing leads to risk fears.
- Happy to use a shared template and log basic evidence (ISI + diary).
- Wants fewer disputes and a reputation that’s more than testimonials.

**Founder ICP**
- First-time applicants; needs a clear checklist.
- Prefers a guided path with a reviewer who signs and submits.

## What each buyer actually values

| Buyer | Must-have | Nice-to-have | Deal-breaker |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reviewer | Accepted export; prep in ≤90 min | White-label; calibration follow-ups | Heavy new software; unclear liability |
| Coach | Higher close rate; fewer disputes | Template flexibility; simple logging | Funds custody; medical claims exposure |
| Client | Fair risk; clear rules | One-page decision export | Hidden fees; vague criteria |
| Founder | “This will be accepted” | Faster turnaround | Ambiguous report; extra rework |

## How we reach them (channels that fit the wedge)

- **Reviewer lane (ABDUCTIO):**
  - **Partner-led:** onboard 5–10 reviewer firms as design partners; co-branded “48-hour Viability” pages.
  - **Direct:** search pages for “viability opinion checklist / sample”; “book a reviewer” flow.
  - **Referrals:** founders who submit accepted dossiers invite peers.

- **Coach lane (Earnest—Sleep):**
  - **Direct sales + referrals:** small cohorts from coaching communities.
  - **Proof pages:** public domain pages show **kept-rate**, instruments, and a sample decision export.
  - **Client-side CTA:** “Try risk-reduced coaching” with a booking flow that previews the pass rule.

- **Virtual (fuels ABDUCTIO):**
  - **Vouchers:** founders (or sponsors) buy **Report Passes** that redeem only for ABDUCTIO outputs.
  - **Merit:** reviewers and AI assessors earn non-monetary **Merit** when their evaluations hold up—so their voice counts more next time.

## Adoption ladder (how we expand without getting ahead of ourselves)

1) **Land**  
   - Boat A: `/entrepreneurship/viability` with `_opinionExport` etc.  
   - Boat B: `/coaching/sleep` with `_twoSessionISIImprovement` etc.

2) **Prove**  
   - ABDUCTIO: ≥80% acceptance; reviewer prep ≤90 min.  
   - Earnest: auto-decision ≥90%; disputes ≤3%; coach opt-in ≥60%.

3) **Expand (adjacent, same rails)**  
   - `/coaching/habit_control/smoking` with `_ninetyDayAbstinence`.  
   - `/services/web` with `_pagespeedScoreAtLeast` and simple acceptance suites.  
   - Keep the rails identical; most new work is **templating**, not engineering.

4) **Deepen**  
   - Add optional instruments (e.g., cotinine test) and jurisdiction parameters (e.g., `jurisdiction:"DE"` in viability).  
   - Run follow-ups to calibrate future ABDUCTIO scores.

## What success looks like (skeptic-friendly, early)

- **ABDUCTIO (reviewer lane)**
  - 10–15 reviewer partners
  - 50–100 accepted opinions in first quarter
  - Prep time median ≤90 minutes
  - Follow-up rate ≥40% at 6 months (for calibration)

- **Earnest (sleep)**
  - 10 coaches live
  - 50–100 promises run
  - Auto-decision ≥90%; disputes ≤3%
  - Conversion up vs baseline (trust premium)

- **Virtual**
  - ≥60% of ABDUCTIO exports funded with **Report Passes**
  - Zero confusion with “money” in support tickets

---

## Why this market holds together (not just two random bets)
- **Shared buyer logic:** “I’ll try if it’s fair and clear.” ABDUCTIO makes “fair and clear” *before* the leap; SPONSIO makes it *after*.  
- **Shared rails:** identity, instruments, payment timing, and exports stay the same as we add domains.  
- **Co-op flywheel:** surplus sharing (patronage) + **Merit** make the best reviewers, coaches, and contributors invite more of their kind.

**Bottom line:** we start where proof is fast and trust is scarce—reviewer opinions and sleep outcomes—then expand sideways using the same rails, the same playbook, and users who now trust us because we made a hard thing simple and fair.
