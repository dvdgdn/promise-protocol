# 5) Why It’s a Fleet (Rendanheyi in a Co-op)

**Short version:** we don’t build a monolith. We launch **many small, user-facing “boats”** that share common docks (the protocol rails) but steer themselves. Each boat earns the right to grow by passing its gates. If one stalls, the fleet keeps moving.

---

## One company, many boats
Think of **ABDUCTIO-DE (viability reports)**, **Sponsio Earnest—Sleep**, and **Sponsio Virtual—Report Passes** as separate boats:
- Each has its **own users, P&L, roadmap, and gates**.
- Each can **start, learn, and scale** without waiting for central permission.
- All of them plug into the same **dockyard** (identity, domains, verification instruments, payment timing, audit exports).

This spreads risk, speeds learning, and keeps teams **close to users**, not meetings.

---

## Rendanheyi in one minute (no jargon)
- **Zero distance to the user:** small teams that live and die by a single promise (“viability dossier in 48h,” “sleep better in two sessions”).
- **Contracts, not hierarchy:** boats buy the rails they need at posted prices; they don’t beg for headcount or fight for roadmap slots.
- **Everyone can start a boat—if they pass the specs:** you don’t need permission; you need to **clear the gates**.

---

## The dockyard vs the boats (clean split)
**Dockyard (shared rails)**
- Keeps the **protocol**: domain registry, identity levels, verification instruments, payment timing, dispute micro-arbitration, audit exports.
- Sells these rails to boats at **posted internal prices** (transparent transfer pricing).
- No product roadmaps for boats; just **SLAs and tests** the boats must pass.

**Boats (value lines)**
- Own the **promise template** and the customer success loop.
- Decide pricing, onboarding, and support playbooks.
- Publish **SLOs** (e.g., auto-decision ≥ 90%, dispute ≤ 3%, support reply ≤ 24h) and report monthly.

---

## How boats cooperate (without committees)
- **APIs + SLAs:** a boat calls the dockyard’s “Authorize → Capture/Refund” or “Evidence Export” just like any external customer.
- **Internal invoices:** Earnest—Sleep pays the dockyard per kept outcome; Virtual pays Abductio-DE when vouchers are redeemed for reports.
- **Escalation is a contract, not a meeting:** if an SLA is missed, credit notes apply automatically; no politics.

**A tiny day-in-the-fleet example**
1. A founder buys **Report Passes** (Virtual).  
2. They redeem for an **ABDUCTIO-DE** viability export.  
3. A week later they hire a **Sleep coach** with **Earnest** terms (“authorize now; capture on kept”).  
4. Outcomes and exports update domain scores automatically—no coordination call required.

---

## Gated autonomy (how boats live)
- **Start small:** 10–20 cases to prove the loop.  
- **Pass gates:** technical (auto-decision, disputes), legal (no custody; closed-loop vouchers), market (acceptance/opt-in), economics (positive contribution).  
- **Scale only after two green months.**  
- **Miss a gate twice?** Boat **pauses acquisition**, fixes one thing, reruns a micro-pilot—or sunsets.

**WIP limit:** max **two boats** in “build/scale” at once. Others docked. Focus beats frenzy.

---

## Incentives that make the fleet row
- **P&L visibility per boat:** everyone sees what works.  
- **Patronage (surplus sharing):** members who create surplus share it.  
- **Merit (non-monetary):** authors of templates/tools that are adopted gain **domain influence** (never control of reserved matters).  
- **Bounties:** the dockyard posts spec bounties; the most merited contributors in that domain get first crack.

Result: people who improve outcomes **gain both money and voice**—and they keep improving them.

---

## Governance fit (coherence without central command)
- **Reserved matters (core protocol, statutes):** multi-class majority; changed rarely.  
- **Domain standards:** voted by the class that uses them (providers for provider rules; reviewers for evidence rules).  
- **Experiments:** permissionless if they pass core specs; they become standards only after adoption.

No one “owns” the fleet from above; **the protocol sets the lanes** and **the gates protect quality**.

---

## Why a fleet beats a monolith
- **Faster learning:** many small bets instead of one big one.  
- **Contained mistakes:** a bad boat doesn’t sink the company.  
- **Clear accountability:** one promise, one owner, one scoreboard.  
- **Less politics:** prices and SLAs replace hallway arguments.  
- **Easier expansion:** new domains are new boats—templating on shared rails, not a platform rebuild.

**Bottom line:** a **gated snowball fleet** lets us grow **wide** (many boats), **right** (gates), and **fair** (co-op)—so trust compounds where it’s earned and the people who earn it share the upside.
