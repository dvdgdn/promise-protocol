# CONTRIBUTING.md â€” HOW WE INCENTIVIZE GROWTH

This document describes how Promise movement intents to grow through decentralized collaboration.

This movement is one of hope and inclusivity, but also responsibility, accountability, and alignment with economic incentives.

# GOAL

The Promise Foundation will be incorporated in a way that makes it possible for *anyone with the will and the capability to contribute* to do so.  The nature of contributions can vary widely, as the protocol is domain agnostic and can support the flowering of any branch of human activity or knowledge.  Not all domains of development are equally impactful for the purpose of growing the protocol itself, however.  The goal of this contribution system is to find the highest-value activities for the purpose of developing the protocol and to incentivize and enable those.

### DOG-FOODING

Promise Protocol enables incentivized cooperation at any scale.

We will use it starting day 1 to cooperate on the development of the protocol itself.

The basic idea is simple and could be implemented with pencil and paper and a transfort system (e.g. US mail).  However, that's the minimum viable product for cooperation, not the **minimum loveable product** (MLP).  We need to balance two concerns in collaborating on building Promise Protocol:

1) We want to discover Promise Protocol's flaws by using it
2) We want to get stuff done

If we only cared about #2, we would use an established collaboration platform like Jira, Notion, etc.  We could move fast, but have little incentive to bring Promise Protocol up to speed to enable complicated collaboration workflows.

If we only cared about #1, we would not be benefiting from advanced collaboration software that's already built (e.g. real time editing of documents for multiple users, ticket systems, etc).  In order to build an effective moat, we need to get an MLP out ASAP.  This MLP is exclusively Abductio and not Sponsio, and therefore, improving Sponsio is a secondary concern.

Proposal: We will tentatively collaborate using Promise Protocol agents, but only insofar as it makes it easier to get our first customer approvals.
